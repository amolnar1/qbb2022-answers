Great work Abby! There are just a few minor issues:
1. Forgot leiden coloring on tSNE (no points deducted)
2. Missing `rank_genes_groups` code and plot for the `logreg` method (-0.5 point)
3. It looks like you have identified some marker genes (and the support UMAP plots look great), but we wanted a final plot that has the 6 clusters corresponding to your 6 different cell types labelled as such. You've got some code that will rename the clusters (although I think it maybe slightly out of order, because it doesn't look like you found a marker gene for cluster 2, even though you've labelled it "MG", but I could be misunderstanding), but you haven't actually made a plot with these new names (-1 point)

Overall, excellent job.
